= psd2html GIMP Plug-in =

This is a Python plug-in for the GIMP that will extract images and text out of a .psd file (or other layered formats) and create an .html template from it. I don't think this plugin will ever fully replace a human coder, but it should be able to do 50-90% of the work.

== Download ==
Go to: https://github.com/SeanHayes/psd2html-gimp-plug-in/archives/master
Right Click on psd2html.py and save to your computer.

== Supported Platforms ==
This plugin has been confirmed to work on:
Ubuntu 10.10 x64
Windows XP SP 3

It should work cross platform, file a bug report if you can't get it working.

NOTE: If you're a Windows user there's a good chance you have Python 2.5, and this plug-in requires Python 2.6, which can be downloaded here: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.6/. Also, I've heard GIMP doesn't currently work with Python 2.7, and definitely doesn't work with Python 3.0, so for now make sure you have Python 2.6.

== Installation ==
Before installing the script, you will need:
Python 2.6
PyGTK+
GIMP 2.6

Python and PyGTK+ will need to be installed before GIMP in order for GIMP to recognize that it can use Python plug-ins and install the necessary components. If GIMP is installed before Python and PyGTK+, it may need to be reinstalled.

If GIMP is currently running, it will need to be restarted after installation.

=== Linux ===
On Linux, copy psd2html.py to one of the following directories:
~/.gimp-<GIMP version>/plug-ins/ (just for your user)
/usr/lib/gimp/<GIMP version>/plug-ins (system wide)

Make sure psd2html.py is executable.

=== Windows ===
Here are download locations for the dependencies:
http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.6/ (Choose "Windows x86 MSI Installer (2.6.6)")
http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.24/ (Choose "pygtk-all-in-one-2.24.0.win32-py2.6.msi")
http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/stable.html (Choose "GIMP for Windows (version 2.6.11)")

Choose your options and click OK.

== Feedback ==
Bug reports and feature requests can be left at the Issues Tracker on GitHub: https://github.com/SeanHayes/psd2html-gimp-plug-in/issues

== Development Resources ==

There's a really good GIMP Python Plug-in development introduction here: http://www.gimp.org/docs/python/index.html

Also, you can open up GIMP and go to Filters>Python-Fu>Console to open up a Python console within GIMP. In the GUI that pops up there's a Browse button you can click that gives you a list of installed plug-ins and library items.
