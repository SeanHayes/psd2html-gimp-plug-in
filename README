= psd2html GIMP Plug-in =

This is a Python plug-in for the GIMP that will extract images and text out of a .psd file (or other layered formats) and create an .html template from it. I don't think this plugin will ever fully replace a human coder, but it should be able to do 50-90% of the work.

== Download ==
Go to: https://github.com/SeanHayes/psd2html-gimp-plug-in/archives/master
Right Click on psd2html.py and save to your computer.

== Installation ==
This plugin has only been tested on Linux, but in theory it should work on Windows as well. If not let me know.

On Linux, copy psd2html.py to one of the following directories:
~/.gimp-2.6/plug-ins/ (just for your user)
/usr/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins (system wide)

Make sure psd2html.py is executable.
If GIMP is currently running, it will need to be restarted.

== Usage ==
Open up a PSD file using GIMP.
On the image window, go to Filters > Web > Convert to HTML.
Choose your options and click OK.

== Feedback ==
Bug reports and feature requests can be left at the Issues Tracker on GitHub: https://github.com/SeanHayes/psd2html-gimp-plug-in/issues

== Development Resources ==

There's a really good GIMP Python Plug-in development introduction here: http://www.gimp.org/docs/python/index.html

Also, you can open up GIMP and go to Filters>Python-Fu>Console to open up a Python console within GIMP. In the GUI that pops up there's a Browse button you can click that gives you a list of installed plug-ins and library items.
