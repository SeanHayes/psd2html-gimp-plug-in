= psd2html GIMP Plug-in =

This is a Python plug-in for the GIMP that will extract images and text out of a .psd file (or other layered formats) and create an .html template from it. I don't think this plugin will ever fully replace a human coder, but it should be able to do 50-90% of the work.

== Download ==
Go to: https://github.com/SeanHayes/psd2html-gimp-plug-in/archives/master
Right Click on psd2html.py and save to your computer.

== Supported Platforms ==
This plugin has been confirmed to work on:
Ubuntu 10.10 x64
Windows XP SP 3

It should work cross platform, file a bug report if you can't get it working.

NOTE: If you're a Windows user there's a good chance you have Python 2.5, and this plug-in requires Python 2.6, which can be downloaded here: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.6/. Also, I've heard GIMP doesn't currently work with Python 2.7, and definitely doesn't work with Python 3.0, so for now make sure you have Python 2.6.

== Installation ==
On Linux, copy psd2html.py to one of the following directories:
~/.gimp-<GIMP version>/plug-ins/ (just for your user)
/usr/lib/gimp/<GIMP version>/plug-ins (system wide)

Make sure psd2html.py is executable.

On Windows, copy psd2html.py to one of the following directories:
C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\.gimp-<GIMP version>\plug-ins
C:\Program Files\GIMP-<GIMP version>\lib\gimp\2.0\plug-ins\

If GIMP is currently running, it will need to be restarted.

== Usage ==
Open up a PSD file using GIMP.
On the image window, go to Filters > Web > Convert to HTML.
Choose your options and click OK.

== Feedback ==
Bug reports and feature requests can be left at the Issues Tracker on GitHub: https://github.com/SeanHayes/psd2html-gimp-plug-in/issues

== Development Resources ==

There's a really good GIMP Python Plug-in development introduction here: http://www.gimp.org/docs/python/index.html

Also, you can open up GIMP and go to Filters>Python-Fu>Console to open up a Python console within GIMP. In the GUI that pops up there's a Browse button you can click that gives you a list of installed plug-ins and library items.
